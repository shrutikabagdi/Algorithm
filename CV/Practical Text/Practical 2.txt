Aim: To understand the basic concepts of digital image processing and 
demonstrate the ability to read and write images using the OpenCV library 
in Python.

THEORY: 
Digital Image Processing: 
Digital Image Processing means processing digital images by means of a digital computer. We can 
also say that it is a use of computer algorithms, in order to get enhanced images to extract some 
useful information. 
 Image processing is the process of transforming an image into a digital form and performing certain 
operations to get some useful information from it. The image processing system usually treats all 
images as 2D signals when applying certain predetermined signal processing methods. An image is 
defined as a two-dimensional function,F(x,y), where x and y are spatial coordinates, and the 
amplitude of F at any pair of coordinates (x,y) is called the intensity of that image at that point. When 
x,y, and amplitude values of F are finite, we call it a digital image. In other words, an image can be 
defined by a two-dimensional array specifically arranged in rows and columns. 

 1.Image acquisition: This involves capturing an image using a digital camera or scanner, or 
importing an existing image into a computer. It could be as simple as being given an image which is 
in digital form 

2.Image enhancement: This involves improving the visual quality of an image, such as increasing 
contrast, reducing noise, and removing artefacts. It is amongst the simplest and most appealing in 
areas of Image Processing it is also used to extract some hidden details from an image and is 
subjective. 

3.Image restoration: This involves removing degradation from an image, such as blurring, noise, 
and distortion.It also deals with appealing of an image but it is objective(Restoration is based on 
mathematical or probabilistic model or image degradation). 

 4.Image segmentation: This involves dividing an image into regions or segments, each of which 
corresponds to a specific object or feature in the image.It includes partitioning an image into its 
constituent parts or objects. Autonomous segmentation is the most difficult task in Image Processing. 

5.Image Compression :Image compression is a process applied to a graphics file to minimise its 
size in bytes without degrading image quality below an acceptable threshold. By reducing the file 
size, more images can be stored in a given amount of disk or memory space. The image also requires 
less bandwidth when being transmitted over the internet or downloaded from a webpage, reducing 
network congestion and speeding up content delivery. 

6.  Image Recognition : Image recognition is the process of identifying an object or a feature in an 
image or video. It is used in many applications like defect detection, medical imaging, and security 
surveillance 

 7. Image Noising and Denoising: Image denoising plays an important role in modern image 
processing systems. Image denoising is to remove noise from a noisy image, so as to restore the true 
image. 





CODE:

Write a program to read and write the image using imread, imshow ,imwrite function of 
opencv library to store image in computer. 


import cv2
def read_write_img(img_path, out_path):
    img = cv2.imread(img_path)
    if img is None:
        print("error")
        return
    cv2.imshow("original img", img)
    key = cv2.waitKey(0)
    if key == ord('s'):
        cv2.imwrite(out_path, img)
    else:
        print("Error")
img_path = "D:\\PyCharm\\Practical 2\\Car.jpeg"
out_path = "D:\\PyCharm\\Practical 2\\Car_Modified.jpeg"
read_write_img(img_path, out_path)


Write a program to read and resize the image and store it using imwrite function.


import cv2

def read_resize_img(img_path, out_path, new_width, new_height):
    img = cv2.imread(img_path)

    if img is None:
        print("error")
        return
    cv2.imshow("original img", img)
    resized_img = cv2.resize(img,(new_width, new_height), interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)

    key = cv2.waitKey(0)

    if key == ord('s'):
        cv2.imwrite(out_path, resized_img)
    else:
        print("Error")

img_path = "D:\\PyCharm\\Practical 2\\Car_Modified.jpeg"
out_path = "D:\\PyCharm\\Practical 2\\Car_Resized.jpeg"

read_resize_img(img_path, out_path, 500 , 300 )

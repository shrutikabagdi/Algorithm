AIM: Prelab-1. Introduction to Python 2. Installation of IDE PYCHARM, JUPITER 3. 
Installation of library OpenCV, NumPy, pandas, Scikit-learn, matplotlib.


THEORY: 
 
Python: is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level 
programming language. It was created by “Guido van Rossum” during 1985- 1990. Python source 
code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Python is designed to be 
highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas other languages use punctuation, 
and it has fewer syntactic constructions than other languages. 
 
Installing python: 
• Open a Web browser and go to https://www.python.org/downloads/. 
• Follow the link for the Windows installer python-XYZ.msi file where XYZ is the version 
you need to install. 
• To use this installer python-XYZ.msi, the Windows system must support Microsoft Installer 
2.0. Save the installer file to your local machine and then run it to find out if your machine 
supports MSI. 
• Run the downloaded file. This brings up the Python install wizard, which is really easy to 
use. Just accept the default settings, wait until the install is finished, and you are done. 
 
IDEs, Editors & online platform for Python: 
An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, enables programmers to consolidate the 
different aspects of writing computer program. IDEs increase programmer productivity by 
combining common activities of writing software into a single application: editing source code, 
building executable, and debugging. 
Following IDEs/Editors/Online platform can be used for python programming:
IDLE, PyCharm, Spyder, Jupyter, VS Code, PyDev, Eclipse, Netbeans, Cloud9, PyScriptor, 
Sublime Text3, Notepad++, Atom, Thonny, Wing, Eric, IntelliJ IDEA, Google Co-lab. 
 
Python libraries commonly used for machine learning tasks: 
NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support 
for multidimensional arrays, mathematical functions, random number generators, and more. 
 
Pandas: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides 
support for data structures such as Series and Data Frame, and includes tools for data cleaning, 
merging, reshaping, and more. 
 
Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a machine learning library that provides a wide range of tools for 
classification, regression, clustering, and more. It includes algorithms for feature selection, model 
selection, and evaluation, as well as utilities for data preprocessing and transformation. 
 
Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a popular library for data visualization in Python. It provides support 
for various types of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, histograms, and more. 
 
OpenCV: OpenCV (Open-Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision 
and machine learning software library. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and functions for 
tasks related to computer vision, image processing, and machine learning. It includes image and 
video I/O, image processing functions, feature detection, object recognition, facial recognition, 
camera calibration, machine learning algorithms, and more. 
OpenCV plays a crucial role in fields such as robotics, surveillance, autonomous vehicles, medical 
imaging, and augmented reality, among others.






Code:

//image

import cv2
img = cv2.imread("D:\\PyCharm\\Practical 1\\Tomato Photo.jpg")
cv2.imshow('image',img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()



// Video

import cv2
def read_video(video_path):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    if not cap.isOpened():
        print("Error opening video file")
        return
    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            print("End of video or error reading frame")
            break
        cv2.imshow('Video',frame)
        if cv2.waitKey(25) & 0xFF ==ord('q'):
            break
    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
if __name__ == "__main__":
    video_file = 'D:\PyCharm\Practical 1\Rose Video.mp4'
    read_video(video_file)

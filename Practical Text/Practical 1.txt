AIM: Understand and apply basic programming concept of Python  

THEORY:
 
  Pandas 
Pandas is a powerful and popular Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides 
data structures and functions that make working with structured data (like spreadsheets or SQL 
tables) more efficient and convenient. Pandas is commonly used for tasks such as data cleaning, 
exploration, transformation, and analysis. 
 
1. DataFrame: A DataFrame is a two-dimensional table-like data structure that consists of 
rows and columns. It's similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table. Each column in a 
DataFrame can have a different data type. 

2. Series: A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type. It's like a 
single column of a DataFrame. 

3. Index: An Index is a labeled array that identifies the rows or elements in a DataFrame or 
Series. It provides a way to uniquely label data points. 

4. Reading and Writing Data: Pandas supports reading data from various file formats such 
as CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and more. Similarly, you can write data to these formats. 

5. Data Cleaning and Transformation: Pandas provides functions for handling missing 
data, removing duplicates, and reshaping data. You can also perform various 
transformations like sorting, grouping, and pivoting. 

6. Data Selection and Filtering: You can select specific rows and columns using labels or 
indexes. Pandas also allows you to filter data based on conditions.
 
7. Operations on Data: You can perform mathematical and statistical operations on data in 
a DataFrame or Series. Pandas provides flexible ways to apply functions to data.
 
Numpy 
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental Python library for numerical computations, 
particularly when dealing with large arrays and matrices of numerical data. It provides support 
for multi-dimensional arrays, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on 
these arrays efficiently. NumPy is the foundation for many scientific and data analysis libraries 
in Python. 

1. Arrays: The core data structure in NumPy is the ndarray (n-dimensional array), which is 
a homogeneous collection of elements of the same data type. NumPy arrays can have any 
number of dimensions. 

2. Array Creation: NumPy provides functions to create arrays from lists, tuples, or other 
array-like objects. You can create arrays with specific data types and initial values. 

3. Array Operations: NumPy allows you to perform element-wise mathematical operations, 
broadcasting (performing operations on arrays of different shapes), and aggregation 
functions (sum, mean, max, etc.).
 
4. Indexing and Slicing: You can index and slice NumPy arrays similar to Python lists. 
Slicing works in multiple dimensions. 

5. Array Shape and Reshaping: You can query the shape of an array and reshape it using 
functions like reshape(), resize(), and transpose(). 

6. Array Concatenation and Splitting: NumPy provides functions to concatenate and split 
arrays along specified dimensions. 

7. Universal Functions (ufuncs): These are functions that operate element-wise on arrays. 
They provide high-performance mathematical operations.
 
8. Array Broadcasting: Broadcasting allows you to perform operations on arrays with 
different shapes, making it easier to work with arrays of different sizes.
 
9. Linear Algebra: NumPy provides various linear algebra operations such as matrix 
multiplication, eigenvalue decomposition, and more. 








CODE: 
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
import nltk 
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize 
from nltk.corpus import stopwords 
print("NumPy Array Example:") 
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) 
print("Original Array:", arr) 
print("Array + 5:", arr + 5) 
print("Array squared:", arr ** 2) 
print("Array mean:", np.mean(arr)) 
print("\n-----------------\n") 
print("Pandas DataFrame Example:") 
data = { 
 "Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"], 
 "Age": [25, 30, 35], 
 "Score": [85, 90, 95] 
} 
df = pd.DataFrame(data) 
print("Original DataFrame:") 
print(df) 
print("\nFilter rows where Age > 28:") 
print(df[df["Age"] > 28]) 
print("\n-----------------\n") 
print("NLP Example with NLTK:") 
nltk.download('punkt') 
nltk.download('stopwords') 
text = "Natural Language Processing with Python is fun and powerful." 
print("Original Text:", text) 
tokens = word_tokenize(text) 
print("Tokens:", tokens)





Output:

NumPy Array Example:
Original Array: [1 2 3 4 5]
Array + 5: [ 6  7  8  9 10]
Array squared: [ 1  4  9 16 25]
Array mean: 3.0

Pandas DataFrame Example:
Original DataFrame:
      Name  Age  Score
0    Alice   25     85
1      Bob   30     90
2  Charlie   35     95

Filter rows where Age > 28:
      Name  Age  Score
1      Bob   30     90
2  Charlie   35     95

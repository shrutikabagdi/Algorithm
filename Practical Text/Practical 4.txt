Aim: Split dataset for Testing and Training a model and print size of it.

THEORY: 
You are given a dataset – “housing.csv.” Load the dataset into a DataFrame. Considering the 
“median_house_value” column as output/target and the rest of the columns as input, perform the 
following tasks:
 
1. Find the number of null values in each column and replace them with the mean values 
2. Split the data into test and train fragments using train_test_split() function in 80:20 ratio 
(80% train, 20% test) 
3. Print the size of test and train data (For both input and output)






Code:
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

iris = load_iris()

X = iris.data      # All feature columns (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)
y = iris.target    # Target variable (species)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

print(f"Training set size: {X_train.shape[0]} samples")
print(f"Testing set size: {X_test.shape[0]} samples")



output:

Training set size: 105 samples
Testing set size: 45 samples

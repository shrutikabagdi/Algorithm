Aim: Implementing the basic Hadoop HDFS Commands like File/Directory 
creation, deletion, update and many more operations.

THEORY: 
HDFS is the primary or major component of the Hadoop ecosystem which is responsible for storing large 
data sets of structured or unstructured data across various nodes and thereby maintaining the metadata in the 
form of log files. With the help of the HDFS command, we can perform Hadoop HDFS file operations like 
changing the file permissions, viewing the file contents, creating files or directories, copying file/directory 
from the local file system to HDFS or vice-versa, etc. 

Before starting with the HDFS command, we have to start the Hadoop services. To start the Hadoop services 
do the following: 

Hadoop mkdir Command  
hadoop fs -mkdir /path/directory_name 
 
This command’s unique feature is the creation of a directory in the HDFS filesystem cluster if the directory 
does not exist. Besides, if the specified directory is present, then the output message will show an error 
signifying the directory’s existence.
 
Hadoop Touchz(Creating an Empty File:) 
hadoop fs -touchz /directory/filename 
 
This command allows the user to create a new file in the HDFS cluster. The “directory” in the command 
refers to the directory name where the user wishes to create the new file, and the “filename” signifies the 
name of the new file which will be created upon the completion of the command. 

Hadoop AppendToFile Command  
hadoop fs -appendToFile <localsrc> <dest> 
 
It allows the user to append the content of one or many files into a single file on the specified destination 
file in the HDFS filesystem cluster. On execution of this command, the given source files are appended into 
the destination source as per the given filename in the command. 

Hadoop ls Command  
hadoop dfs -ls /path 
 
The Hadoop dfs shell command ls displays a list of the contents of a directory specified in the path provided 
by the user. It shows the name, permissions, owner, size, and modification date for each file or directories 
in the specified directory. 

Hadoop chmod Command  
hadoop fs -chmod [-R] <mode> <path> 
 
This command is used when there is a need to change the permissions to accessing a particular file. On 
giving the chmod command, the permission of the specified file is changed. However, it is important to 
remember that the permission will be modified when the file owner executes this command. 

copyFromLocal 
 
The hadoop fs -copyFromLocal command is used to copy files from your local file system to the Hadoop 
Distributed File System (HDFS). This command is particularly useful when you want to transfer files from 
your local machine to the HDFS for further processing or storage in a Hadoop cluster. 

hadoop dfs -copyFromLocal /home/user/data.txt /user/hadoop/input 
 
In this example: 
/home/user/data.txt is the source file on your local machine. 
 
/user/hadoop/input is the destination directory in HDFS. 
 
put: 
 
This command is used to copy files from the local file system to the HDFS filesystem. This command is 
similar to –copyFromLocal command. This command will not work if the file already exists unless the –f 
flag is given to the command. This overwrites the destination if the file already exists before the copy. 
Deleting a File 
 
hadoop fs -rm /hdfs/path/to/file 
 
Deleting a Directory (Empty): 
 
hadoop fs -rmdir /hdfs/path/to/directory 
 
du: 
 
This command is used to show the amount of space in bytes that have been used by the files that match the 
specified file pattern. Even without the –s option, this only shows the size summaries one level deep in the 
directory. 
hadoop dfs -du [-s] [-h] 
 -s:- used to show the size of each individual file that matches the pattern, shows the total (summary) size 
 -h:- used to format the sizes of the files in a human-readable manner rather than the number of bytes.

Aim: Perform data filtration using POS tagging.

THEORY: 
Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP). It 
involves the process of assigning a specific grammatical category (such as noun, verb, adjective, 
adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, etc.) to each word in a text or a sentence. POS 
tagging is essential for various NLP applications, including syntactic analysis, information 
retrieval, machine translation, and text-to-speech synthesis. 

Purpose: 
• Named Entity Recognition (NER): POS tags can be used as features for identifying 
named entities in text. 
• Linguistic Analysis: POS tagging helps in understanding the grammatical structure of a 
sentence, which is essential for parsing and syntactic analysis. 
• Disambiguation: Many words can have multiple meanings and can function as different 
parts of speech depending on the context. POS tagging disambiguates these cases. 

Applications: 
• Information Retrieval: POS tagging can help improve search and retrieval systems by 
considering the grammatical structure of queries and documents. 
• Machine Translation: Accurate POS tagging is crucial for translating sentences from 
one language to another. 
• Text-to-Speech Synthesis: Proper pronunciation and intonation often depend on the 
POS of words in a sentence. 
• Named Entity Recognition (NER): POS tags can be used as features for identifying 
named entities in text.  








 CODE: 
import nltk 
# Download necessary NLTK resources 
nltk.download('punkt') 
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger') 
# Take sentence input from the user 
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ") 
# Tokenize and tag parts of speech 
words = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence) 
tags = nltk.pos_tag(words) 
# Filter and print by part of speech 
print("\nFiltered Words:") 
for word, tag in tags: 
    if tag.startswith('DT'):   # Determiner 
        print(f"Determiner: {word}") 
    elif tag.startswith('NN'): # Noun 
        print(f"Noun: {word}") 
    elif tag.startswith('VB'): # Verb 
        print(f"Verb: {word}") 
    elif tag == 'IN':          # Preposition 
        print(f"Preposition: {word}")

Aim: Write programs to apply different filter on given image using 
OpenCV 
i Averaging Filter ii. Gaussian Filter iii. Median Filter iv. Bilateral Filter. 


THEORY: 
 
Neighborhood processing in spatial domain:  
To modify one pixel, we consider values of the immediate neighboring pixels also. For this purpose, 
3X3, 5X5, or 7X7 neighborhood mask can be considered. An example of a 3X3 mask is shown 
below. 
f(x-1, y-1) f(x-1, y) f(x-1, y+1) 
f(x, y-1) f(x, y) f(x, y+1) 
f(x+1, y-1) f(x+1, y) f(x+1, y+1) 
Low Pass filtering:  
It is also known as the smoothing filter. It removes the high-frequency content from the image. It is 
also used to blur an image. A low pass averaging filter mask is as shown. 
1/9 1/9 1/9 
1/9 1/9 1/9 
1/9 1/9 1/9 
High Pass Filtering:  
It eliminates low-frequency regions while retaining or enhancing the high-frequency components. A 
high pass filtering mask is as shown.

-1/9 -1/9 -1/9 
-1/9 8/9 -1/9 
-1/9 -1/9 -1/9 

2D Convolution (Image Filtering) 
As in one-dimensional signals, images also can be filtered with various low-pass filters (LPF), high
pass filters (HPF), etc. LPF helps in removing noise, blurring images, etc. HPF filters help in finding 
edges in images. 
 
OpenCV provides a function cv.filter2D() to convolve a kernel with an image. As an example, we 
will try an averaging filter on an image. A 5x5 averaging filter kernel will look like the below: 

Implementation in OpenCV: 
These are the most commonly used OpenCV image smoothing filters- 
● Averaging Filter 
● Gaussian Filter 
● Median Filter 
● Bilateral Filter 
● Averaging Filter 
Average (or mean) filtering is a method of 'smoothing' images by reducing the amount of 
intensity variation between neighbouring pixels. The average filter works by moving through 
the image pixel by pixel, replacing each value with the average value of neighbouring pixels, 
including itself.                                                                              
             
The Averaging Filter technique takes the average of all the pixels under the kernel area and 
replaces the central element. The functions cv2.blur() and cv2.boxFilter() can be used to 
perform the averaging filter. Both functions smooth an image using the kernel.   
 
Syntax of cv2.blur() 
cv2.blur(image, ksize) 
  
Here, the image is the image source, and ksize is the size of blurring kernel. 
 
Syntax of cv2.boxFilter() 
cv2.boxFilter(src, dst, depth, ksize, anchor, normalize, bordertype) 
In this function , the src is the image source, dst is the destination image of the same size, 
and depth denotes the output image depth. The anchor denotes the anchor points. By default, 
it is at the kernel point (cordinate (-1,1)). The ksize is the size of blurring kernel and 
normalize is the flag which specifies whether the kernel should be normalized or not. The 
bordertype is an integer object that represents the type of the border used. 



CODE:

#Averaging Filter
import cv2
import numpy as np
img = cv2.imread("D:\\PyCharm\\Practical 4\\Ice Cream.jpg")
im1 = cv2.blur(img, (5, 5))
im2 = cv2.boxFilter(img, -1, (2, 2), normalize=True)
cv2.imshow('images', cv2.resize(np.hstack((im1, im2)), (600, 300)))
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()


#Gaussian Filter
import cv2
import numpy
#using imread()
img = cv2.imread("D:\PyCharm\Practical 4\Ice Cream.jpg")
dst = cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (5,5), cv2.BORDER_DEFAULT)
cv2.imshow('image', cv2.resize(numpy.hstack((img,dst)), (600, 300)))
cv2.waitKey(0);
cv2.destroyAllWindows();


#Median Filter
import cv2
import numpy
#using imread()
img = cv2.imread("D:\PyCharm\Practical 4\Ice Cream.jpg")
dst = cv2.medianBlur(img, 7)
cv2.imshow('image', cv2.resize(numpy.hstack((img,dst)), (600, 300)))
cv2.waitKey(0);
cv2.destroyAllWindows();
cv2.waitKey(1)


#Biletral Filter
import cv2
import numpy
#using imread()
img = cv2.imread("D:\PyCharm\Practical 4\Ice Cream.jpg")
dst = cv2.bilateralFilter(img, -1, 5, 5)
cv2.imshow('image', cv2.resize(numpy.hstack((img, dst)), (600, 300)))
cv2.waitKey(0);
cv2.destroyAllWindows();
cv2.waitKey(1)

Aim: Recommendation System: Create a popularity based 
recommender system at a genre level. User will input a genre (g), 
minimum ratings threshold (t) for a movie and no. of 
recommendations(N) for which it should be recommended top N 
movies which are most popular within that genre (g) ordered by ratings 
in descending order where each movie has at least (t) reviews.


THEORY: 
 
When we provide ratings for products and services on the internet, all the preferences we 
express and data we share (explicitly or not), are used to generate recommendations by 
recommender systems. The most common examples are that of Amazon, Google and Netflix. 
There are generally two types of Recommendation Systems- 
 
1. Content-Based Recommendation System- 
 
A Content-Based Recommender System is one that follows a content-based filtration method 
to generate recommendations to the user. Content-Based filtration is mainly focused on 
recommending similar products to the user based on their history. 
2. Collaborative Recommendation System- 
 
A Collaborative Recommender System, on the other hand, does not take an individual user at 
a time but a cluster of similar or alike users (here, users with almost likely taste in movies), 
and based on those users’ ratings, recommends similar products to those group or cluster of 
users.
